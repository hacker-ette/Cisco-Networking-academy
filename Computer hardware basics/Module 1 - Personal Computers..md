 OBJECTIVE: Installing components to safely build, repair, or upgrade personal computers.
 
  1.1 : General and Fire Safety practices
  1. Turn off and disconnect the power to the equipment.
  2. Wear safety goggles
  3. Bend your knees when lifting heavy equipment
  4. Tape over sharp corners
  5. Don't wear watches or jewelry or loose clothing
  6. Know the location and be able to use a fire extinguisher.

  1.1.1:The Four rules to using a fire extinguisher
   1. P - pull the safety pin.
   2. A -  Aim at the base of the fire.
   3.  S - Squeeze the lever.
   4.  S - Spray from side to side.
   
 1.2: Personal computers and safety
   
  1.2.2:Electrical safety
    - Some parts e.g. power supplies, contain high voltage. It is therefore essential to check the printer manual for the location of high-voltage components.
    - Electrical devices have specific power requirements e.g. AC adapters manufactured for different laptops.
    - Exchanging AC adapters with different types of devices may cause damage to both the AC adapter and devices.
    - Electric equipment must be grounded since it will provide a path of least resistance for the current to flow harmlessly if there is a fault in an equipment.
    
   1.2.3: ESD (Electrostatic discharge)
    - Occurs when a buildup of an electric charge exists on a surface that comes into contact with another, differently charged surface.
    - Static buildup discharges by touching a grounded object before touching  any electronic equipment (Self-grounding).
    
   1.2.3.1 Recommendations to prevent ESD damage.
   1. Keep all components in antistatic bags until you are ready to install them.
   2. Use grounded mats on workbenches.
   3. Use grounded floor mats in work areas.
   4. Apply antistatic wrist straps when working inside computers.

 1.3: Computer Disassembly.
 1.3.1: Tools most likely to be in the tolkit of a PC technician
   1. Screwdrivers with magnetic tip
   2. Extraction tools
   3. A can of compressed air
   4. Screwdrivers for different screw types
   5. A cable crimping tool
   6. A cable tester.
   7. Anti-static Wrist strap and mat
   8. Crimpers
   
  1.3.2: Steps to follow when disassembling a computer
   Step 1: Power off and disconnect the power supply
   Step 2: Disconnect the mouse and keyboard
   Step 3: Remove the case screws
   Step 4: Remove the SATA cables and data cables
   Step 5: Remove the hard drive
   Step 6: Remove the optical drive
   Step 7: Remove the adapter card.
   Step 8: Remove the power supply
   Step 9: Remove front panel connectors.

   6. Secure the heatsink.
   
  1.5.3: Steps to follow when installing the RAM
  1. Open the RAM slot levers.
  2. Orient the RAM chip to the motherboard slot.
  3. Lower the RAM chip into the slot
  4. Press down firmly to lock the RAM chip.

  1.5.5: Steps to follow when installing the motherboard

  5. Lower motherboard into place.
  6. Install the screws into the standoffs.
  
  1.6: Installing the drives
   1.6.1: Installing the hard drive
   1. Position the HDD so that it aligns with the drive bay opening. The power and inteface connectors should be facing out towards the motherboard.
   2. Insert the HDD into the drive bay so that the screw holes in the drive line up with the screw holes in the case.
   3. Secure the HDD to the case using the proper

   1.6.2: Installing the optical drive
   1. From the front of the case, choose the drive bay that you want to hold the drive. Remove the faceplate from that bay if necessary.
   2. Position the optical drive so that it aligns with the 5.25 inch(13.34cm) drive bay opening at the front of the case.
   3. Insert the optical drive into the drive bay so that the optical drive screw holes align with the screw holes in the case.
   4. Secure the optical drive to the case using the proper screw.

  1.6.3: Installing the adapter cards
  1. Find an empty PCIe x16 slot on the case and remove the small metal cover.
  2. Align the video adapter card to the appropriate expansion slot on the motherboards.
  3. Press down gently on the video adapter card until it is fully seated.
  4. Secure the video adapter card mounting bracket to the case with the appropriate screw.
