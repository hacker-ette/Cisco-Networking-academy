1) Buffer overflow:Buffers are memory areas allocated to an application. Vulnerability occurs when data is written beyond the  limits of a buffer. 
2) Non-validated input: Incoming data could have malicious content,designed to force the program to behave in an unintended way.
3) Race conditions: It describes a situation where the output of an event depends on ordered or timed outputs.Vulnerability occurs when timed events dont occur in the correct order or proper time.
4) Weaknesses in security practices: data can be protected through authentication, authorization and encryption. Developers should not create their own security algorithms since they may introduce new vulnerabilities.
5) Access control problems: Vulnerabilities occur due to improper use of access controls.
