1. Behavior-based security : form of threat detection that involves capturing and analyzing the flow of communication between a user on the local network and a local or remote destination.
 a) Honeypots: Used to lure the attacker in by appealing to their predicted pattern of malicious behavior.
 2. NetFlow:  used to gather information about data flowing through a network, including who and what devices are in the network, and when and how users and devices access the network.
 3.  Penetration Testing : the act of assessing a computer system, network or organization for security vulnerabilities.
 4. 
  Five-step pentest process
  1. Planning: the pen tester gathers as much information as possible about a target system or network, its potential vulnerabilities and exploits to use against it.
  2.  Scanning:  The pen tester carries out active reconnaissance to probe a target system or network and identify potential weaknesses which, if exploited, could give an attacker access. Active reconnaissance may include:

-   port scanning to identify potential access points into a target system
-   vulnerability scanning to identify potential exploitable vulnerabilities of a particular target
-   establishing an active connection to a target (enumeration) to identify the user account, system account and admin account.
  3. Gaining access:The pen tester will attempt to gain access to a target system and sniff network traffic, using various methods to exploit the system including:

-   launching an exploit with a payload onto the system
-   breaching physical barriers to assets
-   social engineering
-   exploiting website vulnerabilities
-   exploiting software and hardware vulnerabilities or misconfigurations
-   breaching access controls security
-   cracking weak encrypted Wi-Fi.
  4. Maintaining access:The pen tester will maintain access to the target to find out what data and systems are vulnerable to exploitation. It is important that they remain undetected, typically using backdoors, Trojan horses, rootkits and other covert channels to hide their presence.
  5. Analysis and reporting:The pen tester will provide feedback via a report that recommends updates to products, policies and training to improve an organization’s security.
