Port scanning

 is a process of probing a computer, server or other network host for open ports. It can be used maliciously as a reconnaissance tool to identify the operating system and services running on a computer or host, or it can be used harmlessly by a network administrator to verify network security policies on the network
 The scan will also report one of the following responses:

1.  ‘Open’ or ‘Accepted’ means that the port or service running on the computer can be accessed by other network devices.
2.  ‘Closed,’ ‘Denied’ or ‘Not Listening’ means that the port or service is not running on the computer and therefore cannot be exploited.
3.  ‘Filtered,’ ‘Dropped’ or ‘Blocked’ means that access to the port or service is blocked by a firewall and therefore it cannot be exploited.
