3.1 Mobile Device Overview
3.1.2 Mobility
It means accessing information electronically from different locations outside the home or office. Mobile connectivity is limited only by the availability of cellullar or data networks. Mobile devices have self-contained power in rechargeable batteries, are generally small and lightweight, and do Not rely on other connected peripheral devices, such as a mouse and keyboard, to operate.
Examples of mobile devices are laptops, tablets, smartphones, smartwatches and wearables.

3.1.3 Smartphone characteristics

They differ from laptops because they run unique operating systems designed for mobile devices. 
They have limited OS upgradeability, so they can become outdated and require a purchase of a new phone.
They are usually limited to apps that can download from stores such as Google Play store.
They are very compact and powerful, with small touch keyboards on the screen.
They are limited to only one or two physical connection types, such as USB and headphones.

3.1.4 Smartphone Features
They have location services. Most phones include global positioning system(GPS) functionality. If the GPS is off, most smartphones can still determine the location, in a less precise way, by using information from nearby mobile service antennas or nearby Wi-Fi access points.

They also have the ability to "tether" or share, the cellular data connection with other devices. It becomes a modem when other devices are configured to its cellular data.

3.1.6 Tablets and E-Readers
Even though tablets are similar to smartphones, most tablets do not have the ability to access cellular networks. They also have larger touch-screen displays as compared to smartphones.

E-readers, such as the Amazon Kindle, are special purpose devices with black and white displays that have been optimized for reading text. Although they resemble tablets, they lack many of the features and functions that tablets provide.

3.1.8 Wearables: Smartwatches and Fitness Trackers
They are small devices that are meant to be worn on the body or attached to clothing.

Smartwatches: They are a type of wearables that have a sensor to gather data about various aspects of the body, such as heart rate. Some also serve as displays for notifications from apps, can include GPS location services and the ability to store and play music and playlists.

Fitness Trackers: They are similar to smartwatches but are limited to monitoring the body such as physical activity, sleep and exercise.

3.1.9 Wearables: Augmented and Virtual realities
In Augmented Reality, computer graphics are integrated with what is seen in the real world. In a Virtual Reality (VR), a user wears a special headset which displays graphics from a separate computer. The graphics are immersive 3D and create very realistic worlds.

3.2 Other Mobile Device hardware
3.2.1 Cell Phone parts
Because of their small size, mobile devices do not have field-serviceable parts. Some of the Field replaceable parts include:
- Memory: A Secure Digital (SD) card is used to add memory to many mobile devices.
- Sim Card: A subscriber identity module or SIM card is a small card that contains information used to authenticate a device to mobile telephone and data providers. The card can also hold user data such as personal contacts and text messages. Some phones can have two SIM cards installed and are called a dual SIM device.  
- Battery: Some mobile device batteries can be replaced. Be sure to check the battery for bulging and avoid placing the mobile device in direct sunlight.

3.2.3 Cell Phone wired Connectivity
Wired connectivity varies depending on the manufacturer and the age of the device.
- Mini-USB cable: It is used to connect a mobile device to an electrical outlet charger or to connect to another device in order to charge and/or transfer data.
- USB-C cable: A USB-C cable and port can be plugged in either direction.
- Micro-USB Cable: it is used to connect a mobile device to an electrical outlet charger or to connect to another device in order to charge and/or transfer data.
- Lightning Cable: It is used to connect Apple devices to host computers and other peripherals such as USB battery chargers, monitors, and cameras.
- Proprietary: These ports are not compatible with other vendor ports, but often are compatible with other products from the same vendor.

3.2.5 Wireless Connections and shared connections

Besides Wi-Fi, mobile devices also use the following wireless connections:

- **Near field communication (NFC)** - NFC enables mobile devices to establish radio communications with other devices by placing them close together or touching them together.
- **Infrared (IR)** - If a mobile device is IR enabled, it can be used to control other IR controlled devices remotely, such as a TV, set top box, or audio equipment.
- **Bluetooth** - This wireless technology allows data exchange over a short distance between two Bluetooth-enabled devices or connect to other Bluetooth-enabled peripheral devices, such as speakers or headphone.
A smartphone’s internet connection can be shared with other devices. There are two ways to share the smartphone’s internet connection: tethering and mobile hotspot.
- **Tether** - This uses your cellular phone as a modem for another device, such as a tablet or laptop. The connection is made over a USB cable or Bluetooth.
- **Mobile** **hotspot** - A hotspot is where devices connect using Wi-Fi to share a cellular data connection.

3.2.7 Mobile Device Preventive Maintenance
While designed to prevent light scratching, the touchscreen of a mobile device should be protected using a screen protector.
Preventive maintenance for mobile devices requires only three basic tasks: cleaning, backing up data, and keeping the operating system and applications up to date.
- **Cleaning** - Use a soft, lint-free cloth and a cleaning solution designed for a touchscreen to keep the touchscreen clean. Do not use ammonia or alcohol to clean the touchscreen.
- **Backing up the data** - Keep a backup copy of the information on the mobile device to another source, such as a cloud drive. The data includes contacts, music, photos, video, apps, and customized settings.
- **Updating the system and applications** - When a new version of the operating system or applications is available, updates should occur to ensure that the device is working at its best. An update can include new features, fixes, or improvements to performance and stability.
