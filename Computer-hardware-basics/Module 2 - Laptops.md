 USB stands for Universal Serial Bus. It is a plug and play interface that allows a computer to communicate with peripheral and other devices. The five overall main speeds of the USB standards are as follows:

- USB 1.0: 1.5 Mbps.
- USB 1.1: 12 Mbps.
- USB 2.0: 480 Mbps.
- USB 3.0 and USB 3.1: 5 Gbps.
- USB 3.2 gen 2: 10 Gbps.

The Function (Fn) key when used with the F keys across the top of the keyboard, provides short cuts to performing actions, such as controlling the brightness of the screen, turning Bluetooth on/off, turning WI-Fi on/off. The Fn key enables the secondary purpose of other keys on the keyboard, such as the function keys (F1 - F12).

2.1.6 Motherboards

-The compact nature of laptops requires a number of internal components to fit in a small amount of space. Some components such as CPU, may be designed to use less power to ensure that the system can operate for a longer period of time.
-Desktop motherboards have standard form factors such as the size and shape, while laptop motherboards vary by manufacturer and are proprietary

2.1.7 Internal components
-RAM: Because of the limited amount of space within laptops, memory modules are much smaller than those used in desktops. Laptops use Small Outline Dual In-line Memory Modules (SODIMMs), 
-CPUs: Laptop processors are designed to use less power and create less heat than desktop processors. As a result, laptop processors do not require cooling devices that are as large as those found in desktops. Laptop processors also use CPU throttling to modify the clock speed as needed to reduce power consumption and heat. This results in a slight decrease in performance. These specially designed processors allow laptops to operate for a longer period of time when using a battery.
-SATA drives: There are several storage drive form factors and technologies used in laptops due to their compact size. SATA 2.5 is a specification of SATA hard drive with a compact casing that enclosed 2.5 in. drive platter.
-Solid-State drives: An M.2 drive, is a very small form factor of solid-state drive about the size of a stick of gum. It is very fast and designed for high performance in small, power-constrained devices. Another very fast and compact solid-state drive standard is NVMe which has read and write speeds many times faster than SATA drives.

2.2 Laptop Wireless configuration
2.2.1 Bluetooth
Bluetooth devices are capable of handling voice, music, videos and data. The distance of a bluetooth personal area network is limited by the amount of power used by the devices used. Bluetooth devices are broken into three classifications. 
-Class one - 100mW permitted - 330 feet(100m) approx. distance
-Class two - 2.5mW permitted - 33 feet(10m) approx. distance
-Class three - 1mW permitted - 3 feet(1m) approx. distance
The first time that a bluetooth device connects, the device is authenticated using a PIN. This is known as pairing.

2.2.5 Cellular WAN
Laptops with integrated cellular WAN capabilities require no software installation and no additional antenna or accessories. Many cell phones provide the ability to connect other devices. This connection, known as tethering, can be made using Wi-Fi, Bluetooth or using a USB cable. When a cellular phone allows Wi-Fi devices to connect and use the mobile data network, this is called a hotspot.

2.2.6 Wi-Fi
Laptops usually access the internet by using wireless adapters. Wireless adapters can be built in to the laptop or attached to the laptop through an expansion port. Three major types of wireless adapters are used in laptops.
- Mini-PCI - have 124 pins and are capable of 802.11a, 802.11b and 802.11g wireless LAN connection standards.
- Mini-PCIe - have 54 pins and support same standard as mini-PCI with addition of 802.11n and 802.11ac.
- PCI-Express micro - have 54 pins and support same standards as Mini-PCIe. Commonly found in newer and smaller laptops.

2.2.9  Practice Item - Laptop Wireless Configuration
In order to connect an Android or IOS device to a Wi-Fi network manually, perform these steps:
- Enter the network SSID of the wireless network.
- Choose the security type used by the wireless network.
- Input the password to authenticate successfully.

2.3 Preventive maintenance for laptops
2.3.3 Laptop preventive maintenance
1. Exterior case -Wipe the case with a soft, lint-free cloth that is lightly moistened with water or mild cleaning solution.
2. Cooling vents and I/o ports -Use compressed air or a non-electrostatic vacuum to clean out the dust from the vents and from the fan behind the vent. Use tweezers to remove any debris.
3. Display - Wipe the display with a soft, lint-free cloth that is lightly moistened with a computer-screen cleaner.
4. Keyboard - Wipe the keyboard with a soft, lint-free cloth that is lightly moistened with water or mild cleaning solution.
5. Touchpad - Wipe the surface of the touchpad gently with a soft, lint-free cloth that is moistened with an approved cleaner. Never use a wet cloth.
